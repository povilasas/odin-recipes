<p>The kids I babysit for love these -- red Kool Aid gives ordinary pickles a bright red color and adds fruity sweetness to their normal tang. I'm told they originated in the Southern US. I've also heard they are bar snacks, which may explain a lot. They are pretty, but I have to admit that I don't care for them very much.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
    <li>1 (32 ounce) jar dill pickles</li>
    <li>2 (0.13 ounce) packages unsweetened red KOOL-AID®</li>
    <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Open pickle jar, and pour off the liquid from the jar into a bowl. Add KOOL-AID and sugar to the pickle liquid, and stir until the sugar is completely dissolved. Pour mixture back into the pickle jar, making sure that pickles are completely covered and there are no air spaces. Cover jar tightly and shake well.</li>
    <li>Refrigerate the pickles for at least one week before serving.</li>
</ol>
